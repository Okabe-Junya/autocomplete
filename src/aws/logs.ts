    'You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK. For more information about CloudWatch Logs features, see the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide. You can use CloudWatch Logs to:    Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real time: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.    Monitor CloudTrail logged events: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.    Archive log data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.    CloudWatch Logs might log request contents for fields that aren\'t considered sensitive, such as API request parameters for CloudWatch Logs actions. This provides debugging information for failed API requests',

        "Associates the specified KMS key with either one log group in the account, or with all stored CloudWatch Logs query insights results in the account. When you use AssociateKmsKey, you specify either the logGroupName parameter or the resourceIdentifier parameter. You can't specify both of those parameters in the same operation.   Specify the logGroupName parameter to cause log events ingested into that log group to be encrypted with that key. Only the log events ingested after the key is associated are encrypted with that key. Associating a KMS key with a log group overrides any existing associations between the log group and a KMS key. After a KMS key is associated with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested. Associating a key with a log group does not cause the results of queries of that log group to be encrypted with that key. To have query results encrypted with a KMS key, you must use an AssociateKmsKey operation with the resourceIdentifier parameter that specifies a query-result resource.    Specify the resourceIdentifier parameter with a query-result resource, to use that key to encrypt the stored results of all future StartQuery operations in the account. The response from a GetQueryResults operation will still return the query results in plain text. Even if you have not associated a key with your query results, the query results are encrypted when stored, using the default CloudWatch Logs method. If you run a query from a monitoring account that queries logs in a source account, the query results key from the monitoring account, if any, is used.    If you delete the key that is used to encrypt log events or log group query results, then all the associated stored log events or query results that were encrypted with that key will be unencryptable and unusable.   CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not associate an asymmetric KMS key with your log group or query results. For more information, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys.  It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect. If you attempt to associate a KMS key with a log group but the KMS key does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an InvalidParameterException error",

        "Creates an anomaly detector that regularly scans one or more log groups and look for patterns and anomalies in the logs. An anomaly detector can help surface issues by automatically discovering anomalies in your log event traffic. An anomaly detector uses machine learning algorithms to scan log events and find patterns. A pattern is a shared text structure that recurs among your log fields. Patterns provide a useful tool for analyzing large sets of logs because a large number of log events can often be compressed into a few patterns. The anomaly detector uses pattern recognition to find anomalies, which are unusual log events. It uses the evaluationFrequency to compare current log events and patterns with trained baselines.  Fields within a pattern are called tokens. Fields that vary within a pattern, such as a request ID or timestamp, are referred to as dynamic tokens and represented by <*>.  The following is an example of a pattern:  [INFO] Request time: <*> ms  This pattern represents log events like [INFO] Request time: 327 ms and other similar log events that differ only by the number, in this csse 327. When the pattern is displayed, the different numbers are replaced by <*>   Any parts of log events that are masked as sensitive data are not scanned for anomalies.

You can list all the log events or filter the results using one or more of the following:   A filter pattern   A time range   The log stream name, or a log stream name prefix that matches multiple log streams   You must have the logs:FilterLogEvents permission to perform this operation. You can specify the log group to search by using either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.   FilterLogEvents is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1 MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB. Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. If the results include a nextToken, there might be more log events available. You can return these additional log events by providing the nextToken in a subsequent FilterLogEvents operation. If the results don't include a nextToken, then pagination is finished.  Specifying the limit parameter only guarantees that a single page doesn't return more log events than the specified limit, but it might return fewer events than the limit. This is the expected API behavior. The returned log events are sorted by event timestamp, the timestamp when the event was ingested by CloudWatch Logs, and the ID of the PutLogEvents request. By default, the events are returned in ascending timestamp order (oldest first). To return events in descending timestamp order (newest first), set the startFromHead parameter to false. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account observability.  If you are using log transformation, the FilterLogEvents operation returns only the original versions of log events, before they were transformed. To view the transformed versions, you must use a CloudWatch Logs query",

        "Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or filter using a time range.  GetLogEvents is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1 MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB. Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. As long as the nextBackwardToken or nextForwardToken returned is NOT equal to the nextToken that you passed into the API call, there might be more log events available. The token that you use depends on the direction you want to move in along the log stream. The returned tokens are never null.  If you set startFromHead to true and you don’t include endTime in your request, you can end up in a situation where the pagination doesn't terminate. This can happen when the new log events are being added to the target log streams faster than they are being read. This situation is a good use case for the CloudWatch Logs Live Tail feature.  If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account observability. You can specify the log group to search by using either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.   If you are using log transformation, the GetLogEvents operation returns only the original versions of log events, before they were transformed. To view the transformed versions, you must use a CloudWatch Logs query",

        'Creates an account-level data protection policy, subscription filter policy, field index policy, transformer policy, or metric extraction policy that applies to all log groups, a subset of log groups, or a data source name and type combination in the account.   PutAccountPolicy is an account-wide administrative operation intended for CloudWatch Logs administrators. Because it affects all log groups (or a broad subset) in the account, you should grant logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions only to administrators who manage logging configuration across the account, not to application teams or individual log group owners.   Conflict resolution between account-level and log-group-level policies  When both an account-level policy and a log-group-level policy of the same type apply to a log group, the resolution depends on the policy type:    Data protection — The two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either the account-level or the log-group-level policy is masked.    Subscription filters — Account-level and log-group-level subscription filters are additive. A log group can have up to 1 account-level and up to 2 log-group-level subscription filters.    Transformers — A log-group-level transformer overrides the account-level transformer. If a log group has its own transformer, it ignores the account-level transformer policy.    Field index policies — If a log group has its own field index policy (created with PutIndexPolicy), any account-level policy that uses LogGroupNamePrefix selection criteria or has no selection criteria is ignored for that log group. However, account-level policies that use DataSourceName and DataSourceType selection criteria still apply alongside the log-group-level policy.    Metric extraction policies — Metric extraction policies are account-level only and have no log-group-level equivalent, so no conflict resolution applies.   For field index policies, you can configure indexed fields as facets to enable interactive exploration of your logs. Facets provide value distributions and counts for indexed fields in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console without requiring query execution. For more information, see Use facets to group and explore logs. To use this operation, you must be signed on with the correct permissions depending on the type of policy that you are creating.   To create a data protection policy, you must have the logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions.   To create a subscription filter policy, you must have the logs:PutSubscriptionFilter and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions.   To create a transformer policy, you must have the logs:PutTransformer and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions.   To create a field index policy, you must have the logs:PutIndexPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions.   To configure facets for field index policies, you must have the logs:PutIndexPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions.   To create a metric extraction policy, you must have the logs:PutMetricExtractionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions.    Data protection policy  A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that\'s ingested by your log groups by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. Each account can have only one account-level data protection policy.  Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into a log group. When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log groups before that time are not masked.  If you use PutAccountPolicy to create a data protection policy for your whole account, it applies to both existing log groups and all log groups that are created later in this account. The account-level policy is applied to existing log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up to 5 minutes before sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked. By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the logs:Unmask permission can use a GetLogEvents or FilterLogEvents operation with the unmask parameter set to true to view the unmasked log events. Users with the logs:Unmask can also view unmasked data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query with the unmask query command. For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and masked, see Protect sensitive log data with masking. To use the PutAccountPolicy operation for a data protection policy, you must be signed on with the logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. The PutAccountPolicy operation applies to all log groups in the account. You can use PutDataProtectionPolicy to create a data protection policy that applies to just one log group. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.  Subscription filter policy  A subscription filter policy sets up a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs to other Amazon Web Services services. Account-level subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups that are created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose, and Lambda. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format. The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:   An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.   An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.   A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.   A logical destination in a different account created with PutDestination, for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations.   Each account can have one account-level subscription filter policy per Region. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in PolicyName. To perform a PutAccountPolicy subscription filter operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the iam:PassRole permission.  Transformer policy  Creates or updates a log transformer policy for your account. You use log transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contain relevant, source-specific information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs this transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filters. You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region. A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see  Processors that you can use. Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies. You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class. You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level transformer policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with my-log, you can\'t have another transformer policy filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging. You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information, see PutTransformer. If there is both a log-group level transformer created with PutTransformer and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer.  Field index policy  You can use field index policies to create indexes on fields found in log events for a log group or data source name and type combination. Creating field indexes can help lower the scan volume for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those fields, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, user IDs, or instance IDs. For more information, see Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs  To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the GetLogGroupFields operation. To find the fields for a data source use the GetLogFields operation. For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId. Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId = value  or requestId in [value, value, ...] will attempt to process only the log events where the indexed field matches the specified value. Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, an indexed field of RequestId won\'t match a log event containing requestId. You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups using LogGroupNamePrefix with the selectionCriteria parameter. You can have another 20 account-level field index policies using DataSourceName and DataSourceType for the selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies with LogGroupNamePrefix selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with my-log, you can\'t have another field index policy filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging. Similarly, if you have multiple account-level index policies with DataSourceName and DataSourceType selection criteria, no two of them can use the same data source name and type combination. For example, if you have one policy filtered to the data source name amazon_vpc and data source type flow you cannot create another policy with this combination. If you create an account-level field index policy in a monitoring account in cross-account observability, the policy is applied only to the monitoring account and not to any source accounts. CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following fields:     @logStream     @aws.region     @aws.account     @source.log     @data_source_name     @data_source_type     @data_format     traceId     severityText     attributes.session.id    CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for certain data source name and type combinations as well. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following data source name and type combinations as identified in the following list:  amazon_vpc.flow     action     logStatus     region     flowDirection     type     amazon_route53.resolver_query     transport     rcode     aws_waf.access     action     httpRequest.country     aws_cloudtrail.data, aws_cloudtrail.management     eventSource     eventName     awsRegion     userAgent     errorCode     eventType     managementEvent     readOnly     eventCategory     requestId    Default field indexes are in addition to any custom field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your field index quota.  If you want to create a field index policy for a single log group, you can use PutIndexPolicy instead of PutAccountPolicy. If you do so, that log group will use that log-group level policy and any account-level policies that match at the data source level; any account-level policy that matches at the log group level (for example, no selection criteria or log group name prefix selection criteria) will be ignored.  Metric extraction policy  A metric extraction policy controls whether CloudWatch Metrics can be created through the Embedded Metrics Format (EMF) for log groups in your account. By default, EMF metric creation is enabled for all log groups. You can use metric extraction policies to disable EMF metric creation for your entire account or specific log groups. When a policy disables EMF metric creation for a log group, log events in the EMF format are still ingested, but no CloudWatch Metrics are created from them.  Creating a policy disables metrics for Amazon Web Services features that use EMF to create metrics, such as CloudWatch Container Insights and CloudWatch Application Signals. To prevent turning off those features by accident, we recommend that you exclude the underlying log-groups through a selection-criteria such as LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/containerinsights", "/aws/ecs/containerinsights", "/aws/application-signals/data"].  Each account can have either one account-level metric extraction policy that applies to all log groups, or up to 5 policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the selectionCriteria parameter. The selection criteria supports filtering by LogGroupName and LogGroupNamePrefix using the operators IN and NOT IN. You can specify up to 50 values in each IN or NOT IN list. The selection criteria can be specified in these formats:  LogGroupName IN ["log-group-1", "log-group-2"]   LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/prefix1", "/aws/prefix2"]  If you have multiple account-level metric extraction policies with selection criteria, no two of them can have overlapping criteria. For example, if you have one policy with selection criteria LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["my-log"], you can\'t have another metric extraction policy with selection criteria LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-log-prod"] or LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-logging"], as the set of log groups matching these prefixes would be a subset of the log groups matching the first policy\'s prefix, creating an overlap. When using NOT IN, only one policy with this operator is allowed per account. When combining policies with IN and NOT IN operators, the overlap check ensures that policies don\'t have conflicting effects. Two policies with IN and NOT IN operators do not overlap if and only if every value in the IN policy is completely contained within some value in the NOT IN policy. For example:   If you have a NOT IN policy for prefix "/aws/lambda", you can create an IN policy for the exact log group name "/aws/lambda/function1" because the set of log groups matching "/aws/lambda/function1" is a subset of the log groups matching "/aws/lambda".   If you have a NOT IN policy for prefix "/aws/lambda", you cannot create an IN policy for prefix "/aws" because the set of log groups matching "/aws" is not a subset of the log groups matching "/aws/lambda"',

            'Specify the policy, in JSON.  Data protection policy  A data protection policy must include two JSON blocks:   The first block must include both a DataIdentifer array and an Operation property with an Audit action. The DataIdentifer array lists the types of sensitive data that you want to mask. For more information about the available options, see Types of data that you can mask. The Operation property with an Audit action is required to find the sensitive data terms. This Audit action must contain a FindingsDestination object. You can optionally use that FindingsDestination object to list one or more destinations to send audit findings to. If you specify destinations such as log groups, Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must already exist.   The second block must include both a DataIdentifer array and an Operation property with an Deidentify action. The DataIdentifer array must exactly match the DataIdentifer array in the first block of the policy. The Operation property with the Deidentify action is what actually masks the data, and it must contain the  "MaskConfig": {} object. The  "MaskConfig": {} object must be empty.   For an example data protection policy, see the Examples section on this page.  The contents of the two DataIdentifer arrays must match exactly.  In addition to the two JSON blocks, the policyDocument can also include Name, Description, and Version fields. The Name is different than the operation\'s policyName parameter, and is used as a dimension when CloudWatch Logs reports audit findings metrics to CloudWatch. The JSON specified in policyDocument can be up to 30,720 characters long.  Subscription filter policy  A subscription filter policy can include the following attributes in a JSON block:    DestinationArn The ARN of the destination to deliver log events to. Supported destinations are:   An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.   An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.   A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.   A logical destination in a different account created with PutDestination, for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations.      RoleArn The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination stream. You don\'t need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destination for cross-account delivery.    FilterPattern A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.    Distribution The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to Random for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Kinesis Data Streams data stream.    Transformer policy  A transformer policy must include one JSON block with the array of processors and their configurations. For more information about available processors, see  Processors that you can use.   Field index policy  A field index filter policy can include the following attribute in a JSON block:    Fields The array of field indexes to create.    FieldsV2 The object of field indexes to create along with it\'s type.   It must contain at least one field index. The following is an example of an index policy document that creates indexes with different types.  "policyDocument": "{ \\"Fields\\": [ \\"TransactionId\\" ], \\"FieldsV2\\": {\\"RequestId\\": {\\"type\\": \\"FIELD_INDEX\\"}, \\"APIName\\": {\\"type\\": \\"FACET\\"}, \\"StatusCode\\": {\\"type\\": \\"FACET\\"}}}"  You can use FieldsV2 to specify the type for each field.

        "Creates or updates a field index policy for the specified log group. Only log groups in the Standard log class support field index policies. For more information about log classes, see Log classes. You can use field index policies to create field indexes on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes speeds up and lowers the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For more information, see Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs. You can configure indexed fields as facets to enable interactive exploration and filtering of your logs in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console. Facets allow you to view value distributions and counts for indexed fields without running queries. When you create a field index, you can optionally set it as a facet to enable this interactive analysis capability. For more information, see Use facets to group and explore logs. To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the GetLogGroupFields operation. For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId. Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId = value  or requestId IN [value, value, ...] will process fewer log events to reduce costs, and have improved performance. CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following fields:     @logStream     @aws.region     @aws.account     @source.log     traceId    Default field indexes are in addition to any custom field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your field index quota.  Each index policy has the following quotas and restrictions:   As many as 20 fields can be included in the policy.   Each field name can include as many as 100 characters.   Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, a field index of RequestId won't match a log event containing requestId. Log group-level field index policies created with PutIndexPolicy override account-level field index policies created with PutAccountPolicy that apply to log groups. If you use PutIndexPolicy to create a field index policy for a log group, that log group uses only that policy for log group-level indexing, including any facet configurations. The log group ignores any account-wide field index policy that applies to log groups, but data source-based account policies may still apply",

PutLogEvents actions are always accepted and never return InvalidSequenceTokenException or DataAlreadyAcceptedException even if the sequence token is not valid. You can use parallel PutLogEvents actions on the same log stream.   The batch of events must satisfy the following constraints:   The maximum batch size is 1,048,576 bytes. This size is calculated as the sum of all event messages in UTF-8, plus 26 bytes for each log event.   Events more than 2 hours in the future are rejected while processing remaining valid events.   Events older than 14 days or preceding the log group\'s retention period are rejected while processing remaining valid events.   The log events in the batch must be in chronological order by their timestamp. The timestamp is the time that the event occurred, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. (In Amazon Web Services Tools for PowerShell and the Amazon Web Services SDK for .NET, the timestamp is specified in .NET format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss. For example, 2017-09-15T13:45:30.)     A batch of log events in a single request must be in a chronological order. Otherwise, the operation fails.   Each log event can be no larger than 1 MB.   The maximum number of log events in a batch is 10,000.   For valid events (within 14 days in the past to 2 hours in future), the time span in a single batch cannot exceed 24 hours. Otherwise, the operation fails.    The quota of five requests per second per log stream has been removed. Instead, PutLogEvents actions are throttled based on a per-second per-account quota. You can request an increase to the per-second throttling quota by using the Service Quotas service.  If a call to PutLogEvents returns "UnrecognizedClientException" the most likely cause is a non-valid Amazon Web Services access key ID or secret key',

Using regular expressions in filter patterns is supported. For these filters, there is a quota of two regular expression patterns within a single filter pattern.

For more information about using regular expressions in filter patterns, see  Filter pattern syntax for metric filters, subscription filters, filter log events, and Live Tail.

To prevent unexpected high charges, do not specify high-cardinality fields such as IPAddress or requestID as dimensions. Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric.  CloudWatch Logs might disable a metric filter if it generates 1,000 different name/value pairs for your specified dimensions within one hour.

It typically takes up to 72 hours after that before log events are deleted, but in rare situations might take longer. To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a longer retention setting when it contains log events that are past the expiration date, but haven't been deleted. Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively, wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are deleted.  When log events reach their retention setting they are marked for deletion. After they are marked for deletion, they do not add to your archival storage costs anymore, even if they are not actually deleted until later. These log events marked for deletion are also not included when you use an API to retrieve the storedBytes value to see how many bytes a log group is storing",

You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contains relevant, source-specific information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs the transformations at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filers. You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region. A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. The processors work one after another, in the order that you list them, like a pipeline. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see  Processors that you can use. Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies. You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class. You can also set up a transformer at the account level. For more information, see PutAccountPolicy.

For more information, see Use Live Tail to view logs in near real time.  The response to this operation is a response stream, over which the server sends live log events and the client receives them. The following objects are sent over the stream:   A single LiveTailSessionStart object is sent at the start of the session.   Every second, a LiveTailSessionUpdate object is sent. Each of these objects contains an array of the actual log events. If no new log events were ingested in the past second, the LiveTailSessionUpdate object will contain an empty array. The array of log events contained in a LiveTailSessionUpdate can include as many as 500 log events. If the number of log events matching the request exceeds 500 per second, the log events are sampled down to 500 log events to be included in each LiveTailSessionUpdate object. If your client consumes the log events slower than the server produces them, CloudWatch Logs buffers up to 10 LiveTailSessionUpdate events or 5000 log events, after which it starts dropping the oldest events.   A SessionStreamingException object is returned if an unknown error occurs on the server side.   A SessionTimeoutException object is returned when the session times out, after it has been kept open for three hours.    The StartLiveTail API routes requests using SDK host prefix injection.

After you run a query using StartQuery, the query results are stored by CloudWatch Logs. You can use GetQueryResults to retrieve the results of a query, using the queryId that StartQuery returns.  Interactive queries started with StartQuery share concurrency limits with automated scheduled query executions. Both types of queries count toward the same regional concurrent query quota, so high scheduled query activity may affect the availability of concurrent slots for interactive queries.  To specify the log groups to query, a StartQuery operation must include one of the following:   Either exactly one of the following parameters: logGroupName, logGroupNames, or logGroupIdentifiers    Or the queryString must include a SOURCE command to select log groups for the query. The SOURCE command can select log groups based on log group name prefix, account ID, and log class, or select data sources using dataSource syntax in LogsQL, PPL, and SQL. In LogsQL, the SOURCE command also supports filtering by log group tags.  For more information about the SOURCE command, see SOURCE.

If no key is associated with query results, the query results are encrypted with the default CloudWatch Logs encryption method. Queries time out after 60 minutes of runtime. If your queries are timing out, reduce the time range being searched or partition your query into a number of queries. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account to start a query in a linked source account.
