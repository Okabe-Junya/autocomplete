When you use the agent ID instead of the full ARN, you don't need to URL-encode the identifier. You can optionally specify a qualifier to target a specific endpoint of the agent. This operation supports streaming responses, allowing you to receive partial responses as they become available. We recommend using pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully when processing large responses. For example code, see Invoke an AgentCore Runtime agent.  If you're integrating your agent with OAuth, you can't use the Amazon Web Services SDK to call InvokeAgentRuntime. Instead, make a HTTPS request to InvokeAgentRuntime. For an example, see Authenticate and authorize with Inbound Auth and Outbound Auth. To use this operation, you must have the bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime permission. If you are making a call to InvokeAgentRuntime on behalf of a user ID with the X-Amzn-Bedrock-AgentCore-Runtime-User-Id header, You require permissions to both actions (bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime and bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntimeForUser)",
