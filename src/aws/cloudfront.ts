        "The AssociateAlias API operation only supports standard distributions. To move domains between distribution tenants and/or standard distributions, we recommend that you use the UpdateDomainAssociation API operation instead.  Associates an alias with a CloudFront standard distribution. An alias is commonly known as a custom domain or vanity domain. It can also be called a CNAME or alternate domain name. With this operation, you can move an alias that's already used for a standard distribution to a different standard distribution. This prevents the downtime that could occur if you first remove the alias from one standard distribution and then separately add the alias to another standard distribution. To use this operation, specify the alias and the ID of the target standard distribution. For more information, including how to set up the target standard distribution, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see Moving an alternate domain name to a different standard distribution or distribution tenant in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide",

To list domain conflicts for both standard distributions and distribution tenants, we recommend that you use the ListDomainConflicts API operation instead.  Gets a list of aliases that conflict or overlap with the provided alias, and the associated CloudFront standard distribution and Amazon Web Services accounts for each conflicting alias. An alias is commonly known as a custom domain or vanity domain. It can also be called a CNAME or alternate domain name. In the returned list, the standard distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the standard distribution and accounts that you own, and helps to protect the information of ones that you don't own. Use this operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide www.example.com as input, the returned list can include www.example.com and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (.example.com), if they exist. If you provide .example.com as input, the returned list can include *.example.com and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, www.example.com, test.example.com, dev.example.com, and so on), if they exist. To list conflicting aliases, specify the alias to search and the ID of a standard distribution in your account that has an attached TLS certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to set up the standard distribution and certificate, see Moving an alternate domain name to a different standard distribution or distribution tenant in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated.
