Each part cannot be larger than 100 MB. If the operation is successful, it provides an uploadId which is required by the UploadReadSetPart API operation to upload parts into a sequence store. To continue uploading a multipart read set into your sequence store, you must use the UploadReadSetPart API operation to upload each part individually following the steps below:   Specify the uploadId obtained from the previous call to CreateMultipartReadSetUpload.   Upload parts for that uploadId.   When you have finished uploading parts, use the CompleteMultipartReadSetUpload API to complete the multipart read set upload and to retrieve the final read set IDs in the response.

If you provide request IDs, Amazon Web Services HealthOmics identifies duplicate requests and starts the run only once. Monitor the progress of the run by calling the GetRun API operation. To start a new run, the following inputs are required:   A service role ARN (roleArn).   The run's workflow ID (workflowId, not the uuid or runId).   An Amazon S3 location (outputUri) where the run outputs will be saved.   All required workflow parameters (parameter), which can include optional parameters from the parameter template. The run cannot include any parameters that are not defined in the parameter template. To see all possible parameters, use the GetRun API operation.    For runs with a STATIC (default) storage type, specify the required storage capacity (in gibibytes). A storage capacity value is not required for runs that use DYNAMIC storage.    StartRun can also duplicate an existing run using the run's default values. You can modify these default values and/or add other optional inputs. To duplicate a run, the following inputs are required:   A service role ARN (roleArn).   The ID of the run to duplicate (runId).   An Amazon S3 location where the run outputs will be saved (outputUri).   To learn more about the optional parameters for StartRun, see Starting a run in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide. Use the retentionMode input to control how long the metadata for each run is stored in CloudWatch. There are two retention modes:   Specify REMOVE to automatically remove the oldest runs when you reach the maximum service retention limit for runs. It is recommended that you use the REMOVE mode to initiate major run requests so that your runs do not fail when you reach the limit.   The retentionMode is set to the RETAIN mode by default, which allows you to manually remove runs after reaching the maximum service retention limit. Under this setting, you cannot create additional runs until you remove the excess runs.   To learn more about the retention modes, see Run retention mode in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide. You can use Amazon Q CLI to analyze run logs and make performance optimization recommendations. To get started, see the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics MCP server on GitHub",
