    "Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus-compatible monitoring service for container metrics that makes it easier to securely monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the same open-source Prometheus data model and query language that you use today to monitor the performance of your containerized workloads, and also enjoy improved scalability, availability, and security without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. For more information about Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, see the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus includes two APIs.   Use the Amazon Web Services API described in this guide to manage Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus resources, such as workspaces, rule groups, and alert managers.   Use the Prometheus-compatible API to work within your Prometheus workspace",

Scrapers are flexible, and can be configured to control what metrics are collected, the frequency of collection, what transformations are applied to the metrics, and more. An IAM role will be created for you that Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus uses to access the metrics in your source. You must configure this role with a policy that allows it to scrape metrics from your source. For Amazon EKS sources, see Configuring your Amazon EKS cluster in the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide. The scrapeConfiguration parameter contains the base-64 encoded YAML configuration for the scraper. When creating a scraper, the service creates a Network Interface in each Availability Zone that are passed into CreateScraper through subnets. These network interfaces are used to connect to your source within the VPC for scraping metrics.
