    "You can use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Admin to discover and understand the state of telemetry configuration in CloudWatch for your Amazon Web Services Organization or account. This simplifies the process of auditing your telemetry collection configurations across multiple resource types within your Amazon Web Services Organization or account. By providing a consolidated view, it allows you to easily review and manage telemetry settings, helping you ensure proper monitoring and data collection across your Amazon Web Services environment. For more information, see Auditing CloudWatch telemetry conﬁgurations in the CloudWatch User Guide.
