    "The CloudWatch investigations feature is a generative AI-powered assistant that can help you respond to incidents in your system. It uses generative AI to scan your system's telemetry and quickly surface suggestions that might be related to your issue. These suggestions include metrics, logs, deployment events, and root-cause hypotheses.  You can use API actions to create, manage, and delete investigation groups and investigation group policies. To start and manage investigations, you must use the CloudWatch console",

How long investigations and their data are retained by default.   Currently, you can have one investigation group in each Region in your account. Each investigation in a Region is a part of the investigation group in that Region To create an investigation group and set up CloudWatch investigations, you must be signed in to an IAM principal that has either the AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy or the AdministratorAccess IAM policy attached, or to an account that has similar permissions.  You can configure CloudWatch alarms to start investigations and add events to investigations. If you create your investigation group with CreateInvestigationGroup and you want to enable alarms to do this, you must use PutInvestigationGroupPolicy to create a resource policy that grants this permission to CloudWatch alarms.
