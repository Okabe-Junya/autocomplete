    "Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) change data capture (CDC) records change events for Amazon Keyspaces tables. The change events captured in a stream are time-ordered and de-duplicated write operations. Using stream data you can build event driven applications that incorporate near-real time change events from Amazon Keyspaces tables.  Amazon Keyspaces CDC is serverless and scales the infrastructure for change events automatically based on the volume of changes on your table.   This API reference describes the Amazon Keyspaces CDC stream API in detail.  For more information about Amazon Keyspaces CDC, see Working with change data capture (CDC) streams in Amazon Keyspaces in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. To learn how Amazon Keyspaces CDC API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. To see the metrics Amazon Keyspaces CDC sends to Amazon CloudWatch, see Amazon Keyspaces change data capture (CDC) CloudWatch metrics in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide",
