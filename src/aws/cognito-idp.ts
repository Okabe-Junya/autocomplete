    "With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API, you can link IdP users to native user profiles. Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users at Adding user pool sign-in through a third party and in the User pool federation endpoints and managed login reference. This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object types in Amazon Cognito. Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.   An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients, users, groups, or other user pool functions.   A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Amazon Web Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.   A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make unauthenticated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.   For more information, see Understanding API, OIDC, and managed login pages authentication in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic to support operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make direct REST API requests to Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints. The following links can get you started with the CognitoIdentityProvider client in supported Amazon Web Services SDKs. To get started with an Amazon Web Services SDK, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services. For example actions and scenarios, see Code examples for Amazon Cognito Identity Provider using Amazon Web Services SDKs",

This template includes your custom sign-up instructions and placeholders for user name and temporary password. Alternatively, you can call AdminCreateUser with SUPPRESS for the MessageAction parameter, and Amazon Cognito won't send any email.  In either case, if the user has a password, they will be in the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state until they sign in and set their password. Your invitation message template must have the {####} password placeholder if your users have passwords. If your template doesn't have this placeholder, Amazon Cognito doesn't deliver the invitation message. In this case, you must update your message template and resend the password with a new AdminCreateUser request with a MessageAction value of RESEND.  This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in. If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In  sandbox mode , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production.

If the user that you want to deactivate is a Amazon Cognito user pools native username + password user, they can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser, the user must create a new user account. The value of ProviderName must match the name of a user pool IdP. To deactivate a local user, set ProviderName to Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName to Cognito_Subject. The ProviderAttributeValue must be user's local username. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social IdPs. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using  AdminLinkProviderForUser call. This is also true if the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject. If the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the NameID from their SAML assertion.

        "Sets the specified user's password in a user pool. This operation administratively sets a temporary or permanent password for a user. With this operation, you can bypass self-service password changes and permit immediate sign-in with the password that you set. To do this, set Permanent to true. You can also set a new temporary password in this request, send it to a user, and require them to choose a new password on their next sign-in. To do this, set Permanent to false. If the password is temporary, the user's Status becomes FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD. When the user next tries to sign in, the InitiateAuth or AdminInitiateAuth response includes the NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge. If the user doesn't sign in before the temporary password expires, they can no longer sign in and you must repeat this operation to set a temporary or permanent password for them. After the user sets a new password, or if you set a permanent password, their status becomes Confirmed.  AdminSetUserPassword can set a password for the user profile that Amazon Cognito creates for third-party federated users. When you set a password, the federated user's status changes from EXTERNAL_PROVIDER to CONFIRMED. A user in this state can sign in as a federated user, and initiate authentication flows in the API like a linked native user. They can also modify their password and attributes in token-authenticated API requests like ChangePassword and UpdateUserAttributes. As a best security practice and to keep users in sync with your external IdP, don't set passwords on federated user profiles. To set up a federated user for native sign-in with a linked native user, refer to Linking federated users to an existing user profile.  Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

If you don't specify a value for ExplicitAuthFlows, your app client supports ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH, ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH, and ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH.   The values for authentication flow options include the following.    ALLOW_USER_AUTH: Enable selection-based sign-in with USER_AUTH. This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other ExplicitAuthFlows permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through USER_AUTH without the flow USER_SRP_AUTH being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include CUSTOM_AUTH.  To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the  Essentials tier or higher.    ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: Enable admin based user password authentication flow ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH. This setting replaces the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.    ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.    ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.    ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH: Enable SRP-based authentication.    ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH: Enable authflow to refresh tokens.   In some environments, you will see the values ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH, CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY, or USER_PASSWORD_AUTH.

To clear the session for a user who signed in with managed login or the classic hosted UI, direct their browser session to the logout endpoint. Authorize this action with a signed-in user's access token. It must include the scope aws.cognito.signin.user.admin.  Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation.

This feedback improves the risk evaluation decision for the user pool as part of Amazon Cognito threat protection. To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the  Plus tier. This operation requires a FeedbackToken that Amazon Cognito generates and adds to notification emails when users have potentially suspicious authentication events. Users invoke this operation when they select the link that corresponds to {one-click-link-valid} or {one-click-link-invalid} in your notification template. Because FeedbackToken is a required parameter, you can't make requests to UpdateAuthEventFeedback without the contents of the notification email message.  Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints",

This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication.

For example users can complete an SRP challenge through USER_AUTH without the flow USER_SRP_AUTH being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include CUSTOM_AUTH.
