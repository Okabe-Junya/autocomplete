They act as templates that ensure consistent metadata capture across similar types of assets, while allowing for customization to meet specific organizational needs. Form types can include required fields, validation rules, and dependencies, helping maintain high-quality metadata that makes data assets more discoverable and usable.   The form type with the specified identifier must exist in the given domain.    The domain must be valid and active.   User must have permission on the form type.   The form type should not be deleted or in an invalid state.   One use case for this API is to determine whether a form field is indexed for search.  A searchable field will be annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable. By default, searchable fields are indexed for semantic search, where related query terms will match the attribute value even if they are not stemmed or keyword matches. If a field is indexed technical identifier search, it will be annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable(modes:["TECHNICAL"]). If a field is indexed for lexical search (supports stemmed and prefix matches but not semantic matches), it will be annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable(modes:["LEXICAL"]). A field storing glossary term IDs (which is filterable) will be annotated with @amazon.datazone#glossaryterm("${glossaryId}")',

        'Searches for assets in Amazon DataZone. Search in Amazon DataZone is a powerful capability that enables users to discover and explore data assets, glossary terms, and data products across their organization. It provides both basic and advanced search functionality, allowing users to find resources based on names, descriptions, metadata, and other attributes. Search can be scoped to specific types of resources (like assets, glossary terms, or data products) and can be filtered using various criteria such as creation date, owner, or status. The search functionality is essential for making the wealth of data resources in an organization discoverable and usable, helping users find the right data for their needs quickly and efficiently. Many search commands in Amazon DataZone are paginated, including search and search-types. When the result set is large, Amazon DataZone returns a nextToken in the response. This token can be used to retrieve the next page of results.  Prerequisites:   The --domain-identifier must refer to an existing Amazon DataZone domain.    --search-scope must be one of: ASSET, GLOSSARY_TERM, DATA_PRODUCT, or GLOSSARY.   The user must have search permissions in the specified domain.   If using --filters, ensure that the JSON is well-formed and that each filter includes valid attribute and value keys.    For paginated results, be prepared to use --next-token to fetch additional pages.   To run a standard free-text search, the searchText parameter must be supplied. By default, all searchable fields are indexed for semantic search and will return semantic matches for SearchListings queries. To prevent semantic search indexing for a custom form attribute, see the CreateFormType API documentation. To run a lexical search query, enclose the query with double quotes (""). This will disable semantic search even for fields that have semantic search enabled and will only return results that contain the keywords wrapped by double quotes (order of tokens in the query is not enforced). Free-text search is supported for all attributes annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable. To run a filtered search, provide filter clause using the filters parameter. To filter on glossary terms, use the special attribute __DataZoneGlossaryTerms. To filter on an indexed numeric attribute (i.e., a numeric attribute annotated with @amazon.datazone#sortable), provide a filter using the intValue parameter. The filters parameter can also be used to run more advanced free-text searches that target specific attributes (attributes must be annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable for free-text search). Create/update timestamp filtering is supported using the special creationTime/lastUpdatedTime attributes. Filter types can be mixed and matched to power complex queries.  To find out whether an attribute has been annotated and indexed for a given search type, use the GetFormType API to retrieve the form containing the attribute',

        'Searches listings in Amazon DataZone. SearchListings is a powerful capability that enables users to discover and explore published assets and data products across their organization. It provides both basic and advanced search functionality, allowing users to find resources based on names, descriptions, metadata, and other attributes. SearchListings also supports filtering using various criteria such as creation date, owner, or status. This API is essential for making the wealth of data resources in an organization discoverable and usable, helping users find the right data for their needs quickly and efficiently. SearchListings returns results in a paginated format. When the result set is large, the response will include a nextToken, which can be used to retrieve the next page of results. The SearchListings API gives users flexibility in specifying what kind of search is run. To run a standard free-text search, the searchText parameter must be supplied. By default, all searchable fields are indexed for semantic search and will return semantic matches for SearchListings queries. To prevent semantic search indexing for a custom form attribute, see the CreateFormType API documentation. To run a lexical search query, enclose the query with double quotes (""). This will disable semantic search even for fields that have semantic search enabled and will only return results that contain the keywords wrapped by double quotes (order of tokens in the query is not enforced). Free-text search is supported for all attributes annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable. To run a filtered search, provide filter clause using the filters parameter. To filter on glossary terms, use the special attribute __DataZoneGlossaryTerms. To filter on an indexed numeric attribute (i.e., a numeric attribute annotated with @amazon.datazone#sortable), provide a filter using the intValue parameter. The filters parameter can also be used to run more advanced free-text searches that target specific attributes (attributes must be annotated with @amazon.datazone#searchable for free-text search). Create/update timestamp filtering is supported using the special creationTime/lastUpdatedTime attributes. Filter types can be mixed and matched to power complex queries.  To find out whether an attribute has been annotated and indexed for a given search type, use the GetFormType API to retrieve the form containing the attribute',
