Key features include:   Point-to-point routing with estimated travel time, distance, and turn-by-turn directions. See CalculateRoutes.   Multi-point route optimization to minimize travel time or distance. See OptimizeWaypoints.   Route matrices for efficient multi-destination planning. See CalculateRouteMatrix.   Isoline calculations to determine reachable areas within specified time or distance thresholds. See CalculateIsolines.   Map-matching to align GPS traces with the road network. See SnapToRoads",

For example, you can use this operation to determine the area within a 30-minute drive of a store location, find neighborhoods within walking distance of a school, or identify delivery zones based on drive time. Isolines (also known as isochrones for time-based calculations) are useful for various applications including:   Service area visualization - Show customers the area you can serve within promised delivery times   Site selection - Analyze potential business locations based on population within travel distance   Site selection - Determine areas that can be reached within specified response times    Route preferences such as avoiding toll roads or ferries are treated as preferences rather than absolute restrictions. If a viable route cannot be calculated while honoring all preferences, some may be ignored.  For more information, see Calculate isolines in the Amazon Location Service Developer Guide",
