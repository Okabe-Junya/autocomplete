Within a stream group, you specify an application to stream, streaming locations and their capacity, and the stream class you want to use when streaming applications to your end-users. A stream class defines the hardware configuration of the compute resources that Amazon GameLift Streams will use when streaming, such as the CPU, GPU, and memory.   Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. The following capacity settings are available:     Always-on capacity: This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.     Maximum capacity: This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.     Target-idle capacity: This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.    Values for capacity must be whole number multiples of the tenancy value of the stream group's stream class.  To adjust the capacity of any ACTIVE stream group, call UpdateStreamGroup.   If the CreateStreamGroup request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams assigns a unique ID to the stream group resource and sets the status to ACTIVATING. It can take a few minutes for Amazon GameLift Streams to finish creating the stream group while it searches for unallocated compute resources and provisions them. When complete, the stream group status will be ACTIVE and you can start stream sessions by using StartStreamSession. To check the stream group's status, call GetStreamGroup.  Stream groups should be recreated every 3-4 weeks to pick up important service updates and fixes. Stream groups that are older than 180 days can no longer be updated with new application associations. Stream groups expire when they are 365 days old, at which point they can no longer stream sessions. The exact expiration date is indicated by the date value in the ExpiresAt field",

A stream session refers to an instance of a stream that Amazon GameLift Streams transmits from the server to the end-user. A stream session runs on a compute resource that a stream group has allocated. The start stream session process works as follows:    Prerequisites:   You must have a stream group in ACTIVE status   You must have idle or on-demand capacity in a stream group in the location you want to stream from   You must have at least one application associated to the stream group (use AssociateApplications if needed)     Start stream request:   Your backend server calls StartStreamSession to initiate connection   Amazon GameLift Streams creates the stream session resource, assigns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value, and begins searching for available stream capacity to run the stream   Session transitions to ACTIVATING status     Placement completion:   If Amazon GameLift Streams is successful in finding capacity for the stream, the stream session status changes to ACTIVE status and StartStreamSession returns stream connection information   If Amazon GameLift Streams was not successful in finding capacity within the placement timeout period (defined according to the capacity type and platform type), the stream session status changes to ERROR status and StartStreamSession returns a StatusReason of placementTimeout      Connection completion:   Provide the new connection information to the requesting client   Client must establish connection within ConnectionTimeoutSeconds (specified in StartStreamSession parameters)   Session terminates automatically if client fails to connect in time     For more information about the stream session lifecycle, see Stream sessions in the Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide. Timeouts to be aware of that affect a stream session:    Placement timeout: The amount of time that Amazon GameLift Streams has to find capacity for a stream request. Placement timeout varies based on the capacity type used to fulfill your stream request:    Always-on capacity: 75 seconds    On-demand capacity:   Linux/Proton runtimes: 90 seconds   Windows runtime: 10 minutes        Connection timeout: The amount of time that Amazon GameLift Streams waits for a client to connect to a stream session in ACTIVE status, or reconnect to a stream session in PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION status, the latter of which occurs when a client disconnects or loses connection from a stream session. If no client connects before the timeout, Amazon GameLift Streams terminates the stream session. This value is specified by ConnectionTimeoutSeconds in the StartStreamSession parameters.    Maximum session length: A stream session will be terminated after this amount of time has elapsed since it started, regardless of any existing client connections. This value is specified by SessionLengthSeconds in the StartStreamSession parameters.   To start a new stream session, specify a stream group ID and application ID, along with the transport protocol and signal request to use with the stream session. For stream groups that have multiple locations, provide a set of locations ordered by priority using a Locations parameter. Amazon GameLift Streams will start a single stream session in the next available location. An application must be finished replicating to a remote location before the remote location can host a stream. To reconnect to a stream session after a client disconnects or loses connection, use CreateStreamSessionConnection",

To associate a new application to an existing stream group, you must use AssociateApplications. When you switch default applications in a stream group, it can take up to a few hours for the new default application to be pre-cached. This value is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or ID that uniquely identifies the application resource. Example ARN: arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:application/a-9ZY8X7Wv6. Example ID: a-9ZY8X7Wv6",
