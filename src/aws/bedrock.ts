In other words, there are no alternative answers that are true that contradict the claims.    INVALID - The claims are false.

SATISFIABLE - The claims can be true or false. It depends on what assumptions are made for the claim to be implied from the premises and Automated Reasoning policy rules. In this situation, different assumptions can make input claims false and alternative claims true.    IMPOSSIBLE - Automated Reasoning can’t make a statement about the claims. This can happen if the premises are logically incorrect, or if there is a conflict within the Automated Reasoning policy itself.    TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS - Detected an ambiguity in the translation meant it would be unsound to continue with validity checking.

TOO_COMPLEX - The input contains too much information for Automated Reasoning to process within its latency limits.

This can happen if the input isn't relevant to the Automated Reasoning policy, or if the policy doesn't have variables to model relevant input.
