The Quick Sight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the Resolved flag included.  To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved.     Amazon Web Services account - The Amazon Web Services account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services Services. When you subscribe to Quick Sight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use Quick Sight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region.     Amazon Web Services Region - You can sign in to Quick Sight in any Amazon Web Services Region. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Quick Sight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace.  To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the CLI, you can use one of the following options:   Use command line options.    Use named profiles.    Run aws configure to change your default Amazon Web Services Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information, see Configuring the CLI.      Namespace - A Quick Sight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.    Applied customizations - Quick Sight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account",

For more information about managing identities in Amazon Quick Sight, see Identity and access management in Amazon Quick Sight in the Amazon Quick Sight User Guide.  Getting Identity-Enhanced Credentials  To obtain identity-enhanced credentials, follow these steps:   Call the GetIdentityContext API to retrieve an identity token for the specified user.   Use the identity token with the STS AssumeRole API to obtain identity-enhanced IAM role session credentials.    Usage with STS AssumeRole  The identity token returned by this API should be used with the STS AssumeRole API to obtain credentials for an identity-enhanced IAM role session. When calling AssumeRole, include the identity token in the ProvidedContexts parameter with ProviderArn set to arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/QuickSight and ContextAssertion set to the identity token received from this API.

      description:
        "Starts an asynchronous job that generates a snapshot of a dashboard's output. You can request one or several of the following format configurations in each API call.   1 PDF   1 Excel workbook that includes up to 5 table or pivot table visuals   5 CSVs from table or pivot table visuals    Exporting CSV, Excel, or Pixel Perfect PDF reports requires Pixel Perfect Report Add-on.  The status of a submitted job can be polled with the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API. When you call the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API, check the JobStatus field in the response. Once the job reaches a COMPLETED or FAILED status, use the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API to obtain the URLs for the generated files. If the job fails, the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API returns detailed information about the error that occurred.  StartDashboardSnapshotJob API throttling  Quick Sight utilizes API throttling to create a more consistent user experience within a time span for customers when they call the StartDashboardSnapshotJob. By default, 12 jobs can run simlutaneously in one Amazon Web Services account and users can submit up 10 API requests per second before an account is throttled. If an overwhelming number of API requests are made by the same user in a short period of time, Quick Sight throttles the API calls to maintin an optimal experience and reliability for all Quick Sight users.  Common throttling scenarios  The following list provides information about the most commin throttling scenarios that can occur.    A large number of SnapshotExport API jobs are running simultaneously on an Amazon Web Services account. When a new StartDashboardSnapshotJob is created and there are already 12 jobs with the RUNNING status, the new job request fails and returns a LimitExceededException error. Wait for a current job to comlpete before you resubmit the new job.    A large number of API requests are submitted on an Amazon Web Services account. When a user makes more than 10 API calls to the Quick Sight API in one second, a ThrottlingException is returned.   If your use case requires a higher throttling limit, contact your account admin or Amazon Web ServicesSupport to explore options to tailor a more optimal expereince for your account.  Best practices to handle throttling  If your use case projects high levels of API traffic, try to reduce the degree of frequency and parallelism of API calls as much as you can to avoid throttling. You can also perform a timing test to calculate an estimate for the total processing time of your projected load that stays within the throttling limits of the Quick Sight APIs. For example, if your projected traffic is 100 snapshot jobs before 12:00 PM per day, start 12 jobs in parallel and measure the amount of time it takes to proccess all 12 jobs. Once you obtain the result, multiply the duration by 9, for example (12 minutes * 9 = 108 minutes). Use the new result to determine the latest time at which the jobs need to be started to meet your target deadline. The time that it takes to process a job can be impacted by the following factors:   The dataset type (Direct Query or SPICE).   The size of the dataset.   The complexity of the calculated fields that are used in the dashboard.   The number of visuals that are on a sheet.   The types of visuals that are on the sheet.   The number of formats and snapshots that are requested in the job configuration.   The size of the generated snapshots.    Registered user support  You can generate snapshots for registered Quick Sight users by using the Snapshot Job APIs with identity-enhanced IAM role session credentials. This approach allows you to create snapshots on behalf of specific Quick Sight users while respecting their row-level security (RLS), column-level security (CLS), dynamic default parameters and dashboard parameter/filter settings. To generate snapshots for registered Quick Sight users, you need to:   Obtain identity-enhanced IAM role session credentials from Amazon Web Services Security Token Service (STS).   Use these credentials to call the Snapshot Job APIs.   Identity-enhanced credentials are credentials that contain information about the end user (e.g., registered Quick Sight user). If your Quick Sight users are backed by Amazon Web Services Identity Center, then you need to set up a trusted token issuer. Then, getting identity-enhanced IAM credentials for a Quick Sight user will look like the following:   Authenticate user with your OIDC compliant Identity Provider. You should get auth tokens back.   Use the OIDC API, CreateTokenWithIAM, to exchange auth tokens to IAM tokens. One of the resulted tokens will be identity token.   Call STS AssumeRole API as you normally would, but provide an extra ProvidedContexts parameter in the API request. The list of contexts must have a single trusted context assertion. The ProviderArn should be arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/IdentityCenter while ContextAssertion will be the identity token you received in response from CreateTokenWithIAM   For more details, see IdC documentation on Identity-enhanced IAM role sessions. To obtain Identity-enhanced credentials for Quick Sight native users, IAM federated users, or Active Directory users, follow the steps below:   Call Quick Sight GetIdentityContext API to get identity token.   Call STS AssumeRole API as you normally would, but provide extra ProvidedContexts parameter in the API request. The list of contexts must have a single trusted context assertion. The ProviderArn should be arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/QuickSight while ContextAssertion will be the identity token you received in response from GetIdentityContext   After obtaining the identity-enhanced IAM role session credentials, you can use them to start a job, describe the job and describe job result. You can use the same credentials as long as they haven't expired. All API requests made with these credentials are considered to be made by the impersonated Quick Sight user.  When using identity-enhanced session credentials, set the UserConfiguration request attribute to null. Otherwise, the request will be invalid.   Possible error scenarios  The request fails with an Access Denied error in the following scenarios:   The credentials have expired.   The impersonated Quick Sight user doesn't have access to the specified dashboard.   The impersonated Quick Sight user is restricted from exporting data in the selected formats. For more information about export restrictions, see Customizing access to Amazon Quick Sight capabilities",
